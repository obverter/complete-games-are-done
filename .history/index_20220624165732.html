                        The baseball pitcher's most basic goal — to throw three
                        hittable pitches past the batter without the batter
                        hitting the ball into play — has never changed.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But through baseball's earliest decades, pitchers were expected to do little more than
                        just sort of fling the ball toward the batter, let
                        him hit it somewhere, and let his teammates playing defense in the field take things from there.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And so the old-timey starting pitcher usually
                        pitched the entire, old-timey game because their job was more or less equivalent to a modern
                        beer-league softball pitcher:
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>Please just lob it over the plate, Keith. Don't be fancy. We're here for a good time,
                        not for a long time.</blockquote>
                    <p>
                        When the pitcher that starts a baseball game also
                        finishes that game, the record-keepers award them.
                        with a <strong>Complete Game</strong>.
                    </p>
                    <p>And in baseball's early years, this was a statistic that almost nobody cared about.</p>
                    <p>
                        Because why should they?</p>

                    <p>As an analogy: nobody sends out an all points
                        bulletin when you parallel park your Civic without
                        nuking a fire hydrant, right? So it follows, then,
                        that the old-timey pitcher shouldn't expect much or
                        any fanfare for doing little more than not failing
                        to meet expectations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But this hardly ever happens now. And when it does,
                        it&#39;s a talking point across the league for that
                        day&#39;s news cycle.
                    </p>
                    <p>So what changed?</p>

                    <sup id="fn1">1. For my beloved baseball pedants: I know that the rules around strikes <a
