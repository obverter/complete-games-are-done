                        <p>
                            Through baseball's earliest decades, the pitcher
                            wasn't thought of as a particularly strategic role.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The pitcher's most basic goal — to throw three
                            hittable pitches past the batter without the batter
                            hitting the ball into play — has never changed.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            But rather than try to throw strikes past the
                            batter, old-timey baseball pitchers were expected to
                            just sort of fling the ball toward the batter, let
                            him hit it somewhere, and expect that the defense
                            would handle things.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In that way, an old-timey batter striking out was
                            considered to be mostly a failure on their part
                            rather than a success on the pitcher's.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            And so the old-timey starting pitcher usually
                            pitched the entire, old-timey game because their job was more or less equivalent to a modern beer-league softball pitcher:
                        </p>
                            <blockquote>Please just lob it over the plate, Keith, and stop trying to be fancy. We're here for a good time, not for a long time.</blockquote>
                        <p>
                            And when the pitcher that started the game also
                            finished the game, the record-keepers awarded him
                            with a <strong>Complete Game</strong>. And nobody
                            cared. Because why should they?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As an analogy: nobody sends out an all points
                            bulletin when you parallel park your Civic without
                            nuking a fire hydrant, right? So it follows, then,
                            that the old-timey pitcher shouldn't expect much or
                            any fanfare for doing little more than not failing
                            to meet expectations.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            But this hardly ever happens now. And when it does,
                            it&#39;s a talking point across the league for that
                            day&#39;s news cycle.
                        </p>
                        <p>So what changed?</p>

<sup id="fn1">1. For my beloved baseball pedants: I know that the rules around strikes <a href="https://www.baseball-almanac.com/articles/strike_zone_rules_history.shtml">haven't always been carved in stone</a>. But let's cut me a little slack and agree that the 1880s were a weird time for everyone. <a href="#ref1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">↩</a></sup>
