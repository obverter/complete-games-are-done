            Once upon a time, professional baseball teams typically used one
            pitcher each day. So why do modern teams usually use three, four —
            or sometimes up to 10 — pitchers per game?

                In the game of baseball, the pitcher's most basic goal—to throw
                three hittable pitches past the batter without the batter
                hitting the ball into play—has never changed.
            </p>
            <p>
                (If you're unfamiliar with how baseball is played, boop this
                footnote for a few-paragraph crash-course.<sup
                    ><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup
                >)
            </p>
            <p>
                But during baseball's earliest decades, professional pitchers
                were expected to do little more than just sort of fling the ball
                toward the batter, let him hit it somewhere, and let his
                teammates playing defense take things from there.
            </p>
            <p>
                And so the old-timey starting pitcher usually pitched the
                entire, old-timey game because their job was more or less
                equivalent to a modern beer-league softball pitcher:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                Please just lob it over the plate, Keith. Don't be fancy. We're
                here for a good time, not for a long time.
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                When the pitcher that starts a baseball game also finishes that
                game, the record-keepers award them. with a
                <strong>Complete Game</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                And in baseball's early years, this was a statistic that almost
                nobody cared about.
            </p>
            <p>Because why should they?</p>
            <p>
                As an analogy: nobody sends out an all points bulletin when you
                parallel park your Civic without nuking a fire hydrant, right?
                So it follows, then, that the old-timey pitcher shouldn't expect
                much or any fanfare for doing little more than not failing to
                meet expectations.
            </p>
            <p>
                But this hardly ever happens now. And when it does, it's's a
                talking point across the league for that day's news cycle.
            </p>
            <p>So what changed?</p>

            1. If a pitcher can throw three of these good pitches—called
            strikes—before they throw that same batter four bad pitches, then

            1. If a pitcher can throw three of these good pitches—called
            strikes—before they throw that same batter four bad pitches, then
            the batter is "out,"<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref1">1</a></sup>
            and one of the other team's twenty-seven "outs" is exhausted.
        </p>
        <p>
            If the pitcher throws four bad pitches, or if the batter hits the
            ball into play and reaches base, then that batter becomes a
            "runner," and the next batter comes up, and the process repeats.
        </p>
        <p>
            Every time a runner is able to safely touch all three bases and then
            home plate, their team scores a run.
        </p>
        <p>
            Every three outs, the team playing offense switches to defense, and
            the defense has three outs of their own with which they'll try to
            score.
        </p>
        <p>
            The team that has scored the most runs after both teams have
            exhausted 27 outs is the winner, and everyone claps, and the losing
            team orders pizza and picks up the bar tab.
