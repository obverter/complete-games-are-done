                Once upon a time, professional baseball teams typically used one
                pitcher each day. So why do modern teams usually use three, four
                — or sometimes up to 10 — pitchers per game?

                            The modern professional baseball player comes from a
                            different planet than did their old-timey,
                            horse-and-buggy forebears. Today&#39;s game is
                            faster, higher-scoring, and split-second timed. Most
                            players&#39; skill sets and repertoire are
                            specialized and weaponized so as to befuddle, speed
                            past, and overpower the suckers wearing the
                            other-colored caps.
                        </p>
                        <p>This is undisputed.</p>
                        <p>
                            Also undisputed is that the &quot;professional&quot;
                            baseball player of ~150 years ago was not a
                            full-time, this-is-all-I-do professional. For its
                            first few decades, baseball was a seasonal job
                            played before crowds of maybe a few hundred
                            spectators for the biggest games.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            And owing to the vocation&#39;s part-time nature,
                            almost nobody crafted their game with a specialized
                            approach — beyond some penchant, preference, or
                            aptitude for one position or another.
