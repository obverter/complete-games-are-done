                            Once upon a time, professional baseball teams
                            typically used one pitcher each day. So why do
                            modern teams usually use three, four — or sometimes
                            up to 10 — pitchers per game?

                            The baseball pitcher's most basic goal — to throw
                            three hittable pitches past the batter without the
                            batter hitting the ball into play — has never
                            changed. If he can throw three of these hittable pitches—called strikes—before he throws four unhittable pitches, then the batter is "out,"<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> and one of the other team's twenty-seven outs is exhausted. Every three outs, the team playing offense switches to defense, and the defense has three outs of their own with which they'll try to score.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            But during baseball's earliest decades, professional
                            pitchers were expected to do little more than just
                            sort of fling the ball toward the batter, let him
                            hit it somewhere, and let his teammates playing
                            defense take things from there.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            And so the old-timey starting pitcher usually
                            pitched the entire, old-timey game because their job
                            was more or less equivalent to a modern beer-league
                            softball pitcher:
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            Please just lob it over the plate, Keith. Don't be
                            fancy. We're here for a good time, not for a long
                            time.
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>
                            When the pitcher that starts a baseball game also
                            finishes that game, the record-keepers award them.
                            with a <strong>Complete Game</strong>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            And in baseball's early years, this was a statistic
                            that almost nobody cared about.
                        </p>
                        <p>Because why should they?</p>
                        <p>
                            As an analogy: nobody sends out an all points
                            bulletin when you parallel park your Civic without
                            nuking a fire hydrant, right? So it follows, then,
                            that the old-timey pitcher shouldn't expect much or
                            any fanfare for doing little more than not failing
                            to meet expectations.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            But this hardly ever happens now. And when it does,
                            it's's a talking point across the league for that
                            day's news cycle.
                        </p>
                        <p>So what changed?</p>
