                Once upon a time, professional baseball teams typically used one
                pitcher each day. So why do modern teams usually use three, four
                — or sometimes up to 10 — pitchers per game?

                    In the game of baseball, the pitcher's most basic goal—to
                    throw three hittable pitches past the batter without the
                    batter hitting the ball into play—has never changed.

                    (If you're unfamiliar with how baseball is played, boop this
                    footnote for a few-paragraph crash-course.<sup

                <p>
                    But during baseball's earliest decades, professional
                    pitchers were expected to do little more than just sort of
                    fling the ball toward the batter, let him hit it somewhere,
                    and let his teammates playing defense take things from
                    there.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And so the old-timey starting pitcher usually pitched the
                    entire, old-timey game because their job was more or less
                    equivalent to a modern beer-league softball pitcher:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    Please just lob it over the plate, Keith. Don't be fancy.
                    We're here for a good time, not for a long time.
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    When the pitcher that starts a baseball game also finishes
                    that game, the record-keepers award them. with a
                    <strong>Complete Game</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And in baseball's early years, this was a statistic that
                    almost nobody cared about.
                </p>
                <p>Because why should they?</p>
                <p>
                    As an analogy: nobody sends out an all points bulletin when
                    you parallel park your Civic without nuking a fire hydrant,
                    right? So it follows, then, that the old-timey pitcher
                    shouldn't expect much or any fanfare for doing little more
                    than not failing to meet expectations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But this hardly ever happens now. And when it does, it's's a
                    talking point across the league for that day's news cycle.
                </p>
                <p>So what changed?</p>

                            <sup>1</sup> If a pitcher can throw three of these
                            good pitches—called strikes—before they throw that
                            same batter four bad pitches, then the batter is
                            "out," and one of the other team's twenty-seven
                            "outs" is exhausted.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If the pitcher throws four bad pitches, or if the
                            batter hits the ball into play and reaches base,
                            then that batter becomes a "runner," and the next
                            batter comes up, and the process repeats.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Every time a runner is able to safely touch all
                            three bases and then home plate, their team scores a
                            run.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Every three outs, the team playing offense switches
                            to defense, and the defense has three outs of their
                            own with which they'll try to score.
                        </p>

                            The team that has scored the most runs after both
                            teams have exhausted 27 outs is the winner, and
                            everyone claps, and the losing team orders pizza and
                            picks up the bar tab.
