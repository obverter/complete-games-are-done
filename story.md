## Complete Games: What They Are and Why They're Special
The modern professional baseball pitcher is an athletic mutant. Compared to their old-timey, sepia-toned, horse-and-buggy forebears, they're practically playing a different sport.

The action in a modern professional baseball game is blindingly fast and split-second timed.

Most pitchers breaking into the Big Leagues today can throw a baseball almost 100 miles per hour. From an early age — sometimes as young as seven or eight — the modern pitcher develops a bespoke pitching repertoire that's designed and weaponized so as to befuddle and overpower the suckers wearing the other-colored caps.

But it wasn't always this way.

The professional baseball player of ~150 years ago was not a full-time, this-is-all-I-do professional. For its first few decades, baseball was a seasonal job played before crowds of maybe a few hundred spectators for the biggest games.

And owing to the vocation's part-time nature, almost nobody crafted their game with a specialized approach — beyond some penchant or aptitude for one position or another. The first baseman was often the tallest guy on the team. Outfielders were whoever could sprint the fastest. And pitchers were usually the folks whose throwing arms were least likely to get tired.

Of these and every other position on a baseball field, the starting pitcher's role has changed the most.

For decades, the pitcher wasn't thought of as a particularly strategic role. Rather than try to throw strikes past the batter, the pitcher was expected to just fling the ball toward the batter, let him hit it somewhere, and expect that the defense would put the batter out.

And so the starting pitcher was the pitcher, and the pitcher usually pitched the entire game.

But this hardly ever happens now. And when it does, it's a talking point across the league for that day's news cycle.

So what changed?
