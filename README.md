## What We're Looking For
The modern professional baseball player comes from a different planet than did their old-timey, horse-and-buggy forebears. Today's gam  e is faster, higher-scoring, and split-second timed. Most players' skill sets and repertoire are specialized and weaponized so as to befuddle, speed past, and overpower the suckers wearing the other-colored caps.

This is undisputed.

Also undisputed is that the "professional" baseball player of ~150 years ago was not a full-time, this-is-all-I-do professional. For its first few decades, baseball was a seasonal job played before crowds of maybe a few hundred spectators for the biggest games.

And owing to the vocation's part-time nature, almost nobody crafted their game with a specialized approach â€” beyond some penchant, preference, or aptitude for one position or another.

Of all the positions on the diamond, the starting pitcher's role has changed the most.

Relief pitchers weren't really a structured part of the game in its fledgling years. The starting pitcher was the pitcher, and the pitcher usually pitched the entire game.

So what changed?
